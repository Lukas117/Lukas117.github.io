                <b>The Feedback</b>
                <p>"Welcome Lukas Kollar,</p>
                <p>Thank you for submitting your "Who Am I?" form. 
                    The feedback given here is for you to use when you start the program, so you don't have to respond to it just now.</p>
                <p>Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, why are you interested in IT, in developing software or coding.
                    What makes you interested in this study program in particular? 
                    Does it match your desire to deeper learn about computer science? What will you want to do in the future?
                    I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program. 
                    This will be very helpful in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.</p>
                <p>When looking at your goals after completing the studies, its nice to see you are interested in various sides of ICT including the business analysis and the programming as youll be working with clients. 
                    Again I would recommend you to try and research more, maybe search the career opportunities that interest you in ICT, what would you like to do in your day to day? 
                    How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. 
                    I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different professions in the ICT field.</p>
                <p>Referring to your SWOT analysis, you seem to be serious and with a methodical approach to your tasks, which is a big plus especially when following studies. 
                    Its important for me to remind you to schedule and keep in mind breaks as well, as the studies can become very intense, it is important to remember oneself and your personal time too. 
                    Maybe search for tools to help your over thinking? What has helped you in the past? 
                    How can you experiment with more creativity and out of the box solutions? How are you in working with groups and other people? 
                    Remember youll have a study career coach to help guide you during your studies.</p>
                <p>I am looking forward to meeting you upcoming year and wish you a lovely summer break!</p>
                <p>Shirel."</p>

                <b>My thoughts</b>
                <p>The feedback helped me reflect on my goals and plans in the future. 
                    While not knowing specifically in which IT field I want to specialize I hope I will discover that during my studies.
                    The one thing I am most passionate about is developing software and creating backend functionality for application as well as some frontend web pages.
                    Developing some other strenghts and learning how to tackle weaknesses is also my goal in the upcoming years.</p>
