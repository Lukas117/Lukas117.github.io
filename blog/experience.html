                    <p>I have learnt programming in school and in work, so far in Java, C# .NET, Blazor, and a little bit of Python. 
                        I plan to broaden my knowledge and learn JavaScript or TypeScript and Angular or Vue.js would be nice to know. 
                        There is also the experience with databases and writing SQL. 
                        As a matter of fact also to design the system from the architectural point of view like domain model and so on.</p>
