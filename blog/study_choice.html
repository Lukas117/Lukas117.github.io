                <b>Motivate your study choice</b>
                <p>I have always been keen to learn to code and develop softwares and fields associated with this. 
                    I have chosen this study programme to obtain deeper understanding of computer science and improve my knowledge. 
                    After having finished AP degree in Denmark I wish to obtain Bachelor degree at HZ.</p>
                <b>Study choice activities</b>
                <p>What made me sign up for this program was the consideration of the curriculum and study topics which I found interesting.
                    Looking at the possibilities of the knowledge I can obtain in order to be better in the IT field or to land a better job.
                </p>
                <b>After completing study</b>
                <p>After the studies I want to work in the IT market with developing solutions for different customers. 
                    I expect to learn everything that happens during a development which would be from business to analysis and developing the solution and maybe even deployment.</p>
